# Personalized News Aggregator API

This project is a RESTful API that allows users to register, authenticate, manage their news preferences, and fetch personalized news articles. Each user can define preferred topics, language, and country, and the system retrieves relevant news from an external news provider. The API supports secure authentication using tokens, protects sensitive endpoints, and caches news responses to reduce unnecessary external API calls and improve performance.

The project demonstrates real-world backend concepts such as user authentication, secure password handling, middleware usage, external API integration, caching, and centralized error handling.
